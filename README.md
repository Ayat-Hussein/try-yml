![Ayat is Trying](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-vector/motivational-patches-collection-lets-try-260nw-2368120343.jpg "Ayat is Trying")

_It's me_ trying out the MD file configuration for the first time

~~Benefits of tring it this way:~~
1. it Helps me understand it well after tring whatever features & syntaxes for configuring it
2. It's an unknown **Github account**, so I'm totally out of the woods here
